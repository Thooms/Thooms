## hi there, I'm Paps 👋

🥖 I'm a software engineer, science, and technology enthusiast from 🇫🇷

🔭 Former engineer at Criteo, Travelbees, and Zenly. Did all kind of backend, mobile, maths things, at various level of scale.

⚙️ Various things I believe in, that I try to apply in project I do, and that I'm always happy to talk about:

- Strong typing, and proper type-based modelling are almost always a better answer than the alternative.
- There are three level of scale in a technical project: human scale, velocity scale, and performance scale.
  I aim at navigating better which ones of those should be achieved first at any given moment.
- There is a good first technical answer to a lot of problems in most cases. It usually isn't the easiest one.
- Kindness towards people should be the default.
